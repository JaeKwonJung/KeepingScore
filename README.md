# KeepingScore
Code for 'Interpretable Thermodynamic Score-based Classification of Relaxation Excursions'

Scripts needed to run the examples in the 'Interpretable Thermodynamic Score-based Classification of Relaxation Excursions' are as follows. Note that 1., 2. and 5. can be run on a PC, though 3. and 4. likely require an HPC. 

1. MNIST: VAE_MNIST.ipynb is a jupyter notebook to create VAE embeddings from MNIST data. MNIST_final.ipynb is a notebook with diffusion model training and classification as well as all other MNIST analysis (see Fig. 3).

2. CIFAR10: CIFAR10.ipynb is a notebook with CIFAR10 dataloading, joint VAE+diffusion modeltraining, classification and analysis for the CIFAR10 example (see Fig. 3).

3. Cell type: this folder lists the python scripts used for the celltype analysis. linear_model: linear model, LR: logistic regression model, MLP: multi-layer Perceptron, rand_300_path_4.py: Keeping SCORE model,            TabNet.py, tabnet.sh: tabnet model, XGBoost: XGBoost model.

4. Genetic perturbation: 
                        0_original_data_inspection: this file inspects the original latent space – latent.h5ad
                        1_train_val_test_split: train/validation/test split
                        2_model: our diffusion model used for the perturb-seq anlaysis
                        3_classification: our KeepingSCORE classifier in jupyter version
                        KeepingSCORE_path4.py: keeping score analysis file used for the benchmark with path=4
                        Lr_model: logistic regresswion
                        Model_XGB: XGBoost model
                        Model_mlp: MLP model

5. Protein stability: protein.ipynb is a notebook with protein stability data loading, joint VAE+diffusion regression model training and all other analysis regarding Fig. 5.
